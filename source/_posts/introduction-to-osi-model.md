The **OSI Model** when it was first created came out in two parts :

* The **First part** was the **Abstract Model**.
* The actual model with its seven layers.
* The **Second part** was actually a **Set of specially created protocols**, that were designed to illustrate how the protocols would fit inside this **abstract model**.
* Protocols not actually used in any network system.
* Devices to teach how protocols work with Networks to carry data.
* Model for organizations creating new protocols.
* Stands for Open Systems Interconnection Reference Model.
* Created as a Reference Model and Teaching aid.
* Not intended to reflect any actual network architecture.

**Mnemonics** for memorizing these Layers in the proper order :

* **A**ll **P**eople **S**eem **T**o **N**eed **D**ata **P**rocessing.
* **P**lease **D**o **N**ot **T**hrow **S**ausage **P**izza **A**way
